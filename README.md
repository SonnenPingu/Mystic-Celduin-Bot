Hello :) 

Here is a small bot created on an open source basis.

I use it for the server status of a Minecraft server and as a giveaway bot and as an info bot

It has some features, like link messages, MC status and more.
All embeds can be fully customized.

It is based on slash commands, all of which you can find below commands.

Please note that you have to customize all commands and functions to make it work.

Completely written in JavaSricpt.

You need:
Node.js and Discord.js and FS and Axios so that it can start.

The json format is used to store all data.

This makes the bot more suitable for smaller Discords.


You can make changes as Issu or if you want as Pull Requests.


Thanks for reading and I wish you a lot of fun with it
